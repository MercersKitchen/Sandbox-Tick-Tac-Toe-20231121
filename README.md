# Game Design & Ideas
- [] Refer to Google's Tic Tac Toe
- [] Game board is a square based on the shorter side of the "Game Space"
  - Game space is a ratio of the shorter side
- [] Game space has a unique background colour when activated
- [] Menu system of buttons (i.e show all of them, pull-down style) of modes
  - Play Against a Friend
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Impossible
- [] Scoreboard: indicates whose turn, indicates tokens used, keeps overall score
- [] Small Text indicating whose turn it is
- [] Sharing Button: Screenshot button, Export Game State
- [] Restart Button
- [] Quit Button with warning: quit without saving game state, without saving preferences (i.e. name and colour preferences), 
  - Leads to import of these states

Optional Buttons
- Menu Button: brings up interactive menu for more advanced configurations
- Students to develop this on their own

Main DIV ratios: example
- Main Game Space: 12/13 of height
- Restart and Quit Buttons, bottom 1/13
- 1/3 of main game space: top bottoms
- 2/3 of main game space: short side of smaller dimension of geometry (depends on landscape, portrait, or square)
