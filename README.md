  - Game space is a ratio of the shorter side
- [] Game space has a unique background colour when activated
- [] Menu system of buttons (i.e show all of them, pull-down style) of modes
  - Play Against a Friend
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Impossible
- [] Scoreboard: indicates whose turn, indicates tokens used, keeps overall score
- [] Small Text indicating whose turn it is
- [] Sharing Button: Screenshot button, Export Game State
- [] Restart Button
- [] Quit Button with warning: quit without saving game state, without saving preferences (i.e. name and colour preferences),
